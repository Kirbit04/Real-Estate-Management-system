2. Run the SQL script in your MySQL environment:

```sql
source /path/to/data.sql;
```

### Advanced SQL

Run advanced SQL queries located in `Advanced_SQL/` for various complex data interactions and reporting:

- **`aggregations.sql`**: Aggregation queries.
- **`joins.sql`**: Join queries.
- **`subqueries.sql`**: Subqueries.
- **`client_interactions.sql`**: Manage client interactions.
- **`transactions.sql`**: Track transactions.
- **`automated_communications.sql`**: Automate communications.
- **`reporting_analytics.sql`**: Reporting and analytics schema.

### CRUD Operations

Perform CRUD operations using SQL scripts located in `CRUD_Operations/`:

- **`create.sql`**: Insert new data.
- **`delete.sql`**: Delete existing data.
- **`read.sql`**: Read data from tables.
- **`update.sql`**: Update existing data.

### Reporting

Generate reports using the queries in `Reports/Reports.sql` and view the final report in `Reports/Final report(3).pdf`.
